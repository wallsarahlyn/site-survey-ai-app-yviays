It must automatically calculate pitch, dimensions, linear measurements, and total square footage for every section, and allow users to label hips, valleys, ridges, eaves, and penetrations. The drawing tool should work smoothly on desktop and mobile, save diagrams to the cloud, and integrate seamlessly with the AI inspection workflow so the roof diagram, measurements, AI results, and instant quote all appear in the final PDF report.\u201d\r\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand you want to build a mobile app using React Native and Expo 54 that allows users to upload site survey photos, analyze them with AI, generate inspection reports and instant quotes, and includes a roof drawing tool. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Image Upload and AI Analysis:** Implement the core functionality for users to upload photos and trigger the AI analysis. This will involve creating a screen for image uploads and integrating with an AI service (this part is out of scope for this project, so we'll mock the AI analysis for now).\n*   **PDF Report Generation:** Design the structure and layout of the multi-page PDF inspection report. Initially, this will include the uploaded photos and the mocked AI findings.\n*   **Roof Drawing Tool Integration:** Integrate a basic version of the roof drawing tool, allowing users to outline roof facets and calculate basic measurements. This will be a simplified version of the full-featured tool you described.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#2962FF` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#4CAF50` (Green)\n    *   Accent: `#FFAB40` (Orange)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD54F` (Yellow)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo 54.\n2.  **UI Structure:** Create the basic UI structure with tabs for \"Home,\" \"Upload,\" and \"Drawing Tool.\"\n3.  **Implement Image Upload:** Implement the image upload functionality in the \"Upload\" tab.\n4.  **Mock AI Analysis:** Create a placeholder function that simulates AI analysis and returns mock data.\n5.  **PDF Generation:** Implement the PDF report generation using a library like `react-native-pdf`.\n6.  **Drawing Tool:** Integrate a simplified version of the roof drawing tool using a library like `react-native-svg`.\n7.  **Integrate all the components:** Integrate all the components together.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAlso, I will instruct the coding agent to remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-23T00:11:21.600862"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this comprehensive property inspection app with AI analysis, PDF report generation, and a roof drawing tool.

Created a new Inspection Context** (`contexts/InspectionContext.tsx`):\n- Centralized state management for all inspection data\n- Stores: roof diagram, images, analysis results, quote, and property address\n- Ensures all tabs access the same, up-to-date data\n- Provides a `resetInspection()` function to clear all data\n\n**2. Updated App Layout** (`app/_layout.tsx`):\n- Wrapped the entire app with `InspectionProvider`\n- Makes inspection data available throughout the app\n\n**3. Updated Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):\n- Now uses the `useInspection()` hook to access shared state\n- Removed local state for data that should be shared\n- Added visual indicator when a roof diagram is available\n- Logs roof diagram data when generating PDF for debugging\n- All data is now synchronized across the app\n\n**4. Updated Drawing Screen** (`app/(tabs)/drawing.tsx`):\n- Now uses the `useInspection()` hook to save roof diagrams\n- When a diagram is saved, it's immediately available to the home screen\n- Shows a confirmation alert with diagram details\n\n**5.
